# CodingPuzzles
Storing all of my blind solutions to LeetCode problems, Meta Puzzles, and so on. Also some data structures and algorithms practice.

Currently supports Windows. Setup scripts support Visual Studio 2017-2022.

## Requirements
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (3.5 or above)
- [Visual Studio 2017+](https://visualstudio.com)

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned the repository, run `/scripts/generate_build_windows.bat` to generate the Visual Studio solution (in the build directory).

Once the script finishes successfully, you can open the VS solution (`/build/LeetCodeSolutions.sln`) and build using your desired configuration.
